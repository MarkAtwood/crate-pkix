//! RFC 4158 certification path building for [`pkix_path`].
//!
//! Accepts an unordered collection of certificates ([`CertPool`]) and
//! constructs a valid ordered chain suitable for [`pkix_path::validate_path`].
//!
//! # Relationship to `pkix-path`
//!
//! `pkix-path` validates a caller-ordered `&[Certificate]`. This crate
//! handles the prior step: discovering and ordering that chain from a bag
//! of certificates when the caller does not know the chain order in advance.
//! Cross-certificates and bridge CA topologies are handled here, not in
//! `pkix-path`.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! [`build_path`] and [`build_path_with_config`] use iterative-deepening DFS
//! (RFC 4158 §2.5): they try increasing maximum path depths from 1 up to
//! [`PathBuilderConfig::max_depth`] (default [`DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH`] = 10),
//! performing a full DFS at each depth. This guarantees that the shortest
//! valid path is returned while bounding memory to O(depth) stack frames
//! per attempt.
//!
//! # Spec references
//!
//! - RFC 4158 — Internet X.509 PKI: Certification Path Building
//! - RFC 5280 §6.1 — the validation algorithm this crate feeds into
//!
//! # `no_std`
//!
//! This crate is `no_std` but requires the `alloc` crate. The `extern crate alloc`
//! declaration is provided automatically; you do not need to add it yourself, but
//! your target must supply a global allocator (e.g., `#[global_allocator]`).

///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// Single-pass depth-first search at the configured `max_depth`. Candidates
/// at each frame are ordered by AKI/SKI tier (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.1) so
/// disambiguating bridge-CA / cross-cert topologies succeeds on the first

/// `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` algorithm OID + raw public-key bits; algorithm
/// parameters are excluded so RFC 8017 absent-vs-NULL ambiguity in
/// rsaEncryption SPKIs does not break detection.
///
/// This is a thin wrapper over the [`PathCandidates`] iterator: it returns
/// the iterator's first yield, or invokes a depth+1 probe (with fresh
/// budget) on `None` to distinguish [`Error::NoPathFound`] from
/// [`Error::DepthExceeded`].
///
/// # Errors
///
/// - [`Error::NoPathFound`] — no topologically valid path through `pool` leads
///   to any of the given trust anchors.
/// - [`Error::DepthExceeded`] — a path exists topologically but requires more
///   than [`PathBuilderConfig::max_depth`] intermediate certificates.
/// - [`Error::BudgetExceeded`] — the DFS frame-entry budget was exhausted
///   before a path was found; the pool may be adversarially large or
///   structured to produce exponential search.
///
/// # Choosing between `build_path`, the iterator, and `build_first_valid_path`
///
/// Use this single-shot API when:
/// - the pool is from a trusted source (in-house cert store, configured
///   intermediate bundle), and
/// - finding any topologically valid chain is sufficient (the caller does
///   not need to retry with alternate chains if signature verification
///   fails downstream).
///
/// Use [`build_path_candidates`] (or its `_with_config` sibling) when you
/// want full control over candidate iteration — for adversarial pools (CMS
/// `SignedData.certificates` bags, federal-bridge cross-cert topologies,
/// anywhere the wire-order of certs is not under your control) so failed
/// signature verification can be retried against the next candidate path.
/// See [`PathCandidates`] for the build-then-validate retry-loop pattern.
///
/// Use [`build_first_valid_path`] (or its `_with_config` sibling) for the
/// common case of "iterate candidates until one validates": it wraps the
/// iterator + [`pkix_path::validate_path`] retry loop and returns the
/// first chain that survives both topological build and signature
/// verification. Prefer this over `build_path` when the pool contains
/// alternatives whose signatures may be rejected by the verifier (e.g.,
/// cross-signed intermediates using algorithms outside the verifier's
/// dispatch table).
///
/// # Limitations
///
/// **Candidate selection uses AKI/SKI as an ordering heuristic, not a
/// security gate.** When the cert seeking an issuer carries an
/// `AuthorityKeyIdentifier` extension with a `keyIdentifier` field
/// (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.1), pool candidates whose `SubjectKeyIdentifier`
/// (§4.2.1.2) matches are tried before DN-only matches. This is
/// best-effort disambiguation for bridge-CA and key-rollover topologies
/// where multiple CA certs share an issuer DN. The signature itself is
/// **not** verified by this crate — that happens downstream in
/// [`pkix_path::validate_path`]. Consequences:
///
/// - When the AKI heuristic picks the wrong candidate (e.g., AKI is
///   absent or malformed, multiple candidates share the same SKI, or
///   the AKI/SKI binding is wrong), the returned chain may fail
///   `validate_path` with `SignatureInvalid` rather than
///   [`Error::NoPathFound`] here. Callers handling adversarial pools
///   should use [`build_path_candidates`] to retry alternate chains.
/// - Malformed AKI or SKI extensions are treated as if absent (fail-soft).
///   They do not cause path building to abort; they simply degrade
///   selection to DN-only ranking for that cert.
/// - The AKI `authorityCertIssuer` + `authorityCertSerialNumber` fields
///   (the rare alternative to `keyIdentifier`) are not currently used for
///   ranking. Only the `keyIdentifier` field participates.
///
/// **Anchor matching is by DN only.** When a candidate's issuer DN matches
/// any anchor in `anchors`, path building terminates immediately with that
/// chain — the anchor's `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` is **not** verified against
/// what the chain expects.
///
/// **Shortest-first is no longer guaranteed.** Earlier versions of this
/// crate used iterative-deepening DFS to return the shortest topology
/// first. The single-pass DFS used now (which shares state with the
/// `PathCandidates` iterator) yields paths in depth-first order. For
/// typical pools the first yielded chain is still the shortest; for
/// adversarial pools, a deeper chain may be returned first if its branch
/// is explored before a shallower alternative. If shortest-first matters,
/// inspect the returned chain length and (rarely) re-run with a tightened
/// `max_depth`.

/// budget enforces a hard cap on search work to prevent denial-of-service
